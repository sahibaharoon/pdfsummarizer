We also look at how to deal with conflict in a NoSQL database. We conclude with a list of rules for dealing with transactions in the database. In the next section, we'll look at a problem of how to handle conflict in the NoSQL Database. OS is a programming language for computers. OS has a number of built-in features. OS can be used to solve problems such as context switching, memory space and FIFO. It can also be used for data structure in BFS and DFS. Semaphore starts with a value of 10. Each P operation decrements the value by 1. With 12 P operations, the value decreases by 12 (10 - 12 = -2). A semaphore value cannot be negative. In such cases, processes attempting a P operation would block until a V operation allows them to proceed. For the final semaphore value to be 7, x (the number of V operations) must be 9. Since each V operation adds 1, we need x to be equal to 9. Pumping lemma is used to prove that given grammar is not regular. Chomsky hierarchy Type 3: Regular Grammar Type 2: Context free grammar Type 1: Context sensitive grammar DBMS. One-to-Many (1:N): This is more common. One author can write many books (N), but a book can only have one author (1). Many-to -Many (N:M): Many books can have many authors (M:N) Maximum size of join = mn.
