Data structure in BFS and D Notations: Cardinality Ratio, Natural Join, Functional dependency, Closure set of attribute, Prime attribute. Normalization: First Normal Form Problem Solution Second Normal Form Third Normal Form BCNF (Boyce Codd Normal Form) Summary: Lossless and Lossy Decomposition. AC Make a table of symbol, stack and postfix Add each element to symbol Insert only operators and brackets to stack Letters are added directly to postfix. In the stack the precedence should be in ascending order.
